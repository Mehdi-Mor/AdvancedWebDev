# Javascript beginner videos

## Video 1
It was a small introduction to the series, and all the members who were part of making the serie introduced themselves

## Video 2
Main idea was what is Javascript in short, it is a programming language for creating enything, and it is the most used programming language in the world used by bug companies like meta and also used to make vscode and slack.

## Video 3
Difference between javascript on the client and on the browser. On the client for example website and html code to build user interface, about srver side, you need node js to perform task specific to server side like reading texts.

## Video 4
This video contained what you need to work with javascript, there were mentionned different tools like eslint, prettier and ES6 code snippets, also node js the runtime of javascript. Last was mentionned NVM tool that manage installing node js.

## Video 5
How to add eslint extension and how to download nvm to set up javascript.

## Video 6
How to build your own project on vscode. It was also explained how to use console log which is essential, and the quotes, double quotes or the backticks for variables.

## Video 7
Explains what comments are and why programmers use them. It also shows single-line and multi-line comments and explains that comments dont affect the code. Also you can use them to leave yourself a comment in the future because you tend to forget with time.

## Video 8
This was like other demos showing how to use comments, and the example showed how everything is clear with comments and as i mentionned before, you will remember your code later if you come back. 

## Video 9
This video explained different variables that can be used like let, const and var. And i remember that const should be used as a default because it saves your variable.

## Video 10
There were some examples of different type of variables,I want to mention that when trying to change const in one example it gives an error, and thats a good way to save your data, , unlike var who is leaky a bit and it caused some kind of bugs.

## Video 11
This video was mainly talking about strings, how to create them, use operations on them and methods just like python course, like combining text.Also if you try to subtract for example "hello" and "worls" it gives NaN.

## Video 12
Example video for strings, shows how they behave with methods. The methods used in the examples were .length, .toUpperCase() without forgetting the parentheses!

## Video 13
This was a really smooth for me. Template literals make it easier to combine variables and text without getting lost in a mess of plus signs and quotes. Also dont forget to use backsticks for the trick to work, for python it was normal quotes.

## Video 14
This was again a demo on how o use template literals. Also there was a warning again from the person talkin to use backsticks insteasd of quotes, otherwise it print as normal text and nor value of the variable.

## Video 15
It explains different data types like string, number, boolean, null, and undefined. Types matter in programming, also in java variables can be converted, and typeof null returns object, it was said that its a famous bug in javascript.

## Video 16
This video was covering how to see types of the variable using typeof function, and there was an example on typeof null that i previously mentionned

## Video 17
It covered basic maths operations and also complex ones using Math object. There was the operation % that return the raminder used in all languages if im not mistaken, and also Math.floor() and Math.round() cause beginners often use the wrong one and end up with errors in their code.

## Video 18
I saw the application of %, its used to see if the number is odd or even, and also bunch of other operations.

## Video 19
This video was all about converting data types, especially strings to numbers, for example on websites, all user inputs are strings, so we have to convert them somehow to handle calculations, and also converting strings like letters, it gives you NaN.

## Video 20
Demo on convertions, there was somthing funny about javascript is when doing 1+'1' it give you "11", but when you do 1-'1' it give you 0 :p

## Video 21
This video was about adding error handling. And that makes your code strong in some way, and prevent it from crashing, so basically handling the error, it was mentionned try/catch/finally.

## Video 22
This was about how to actually code the error handling thing, the example was about a inexistant function, and normally the code will crash if there was no error handling.

## Video 23
This was a small introduction how to work with dates in JS. I learned how JavaScript uses a specific object to track time, starting from a "Unix Epoch" in 1970. Also there was a mention of months that January is indexed as 0, while December is 11.

## Video 24
it shows how to create a date for "right now" with new Date().And also how to retrieve a specific part of a date. I learned that .getMonth() on a July date will return 6, which confuses beginners.

## Video 25
This was about boolean logic like if statement. I liked how he referred to the program and said that these boolean logic allow him to make decisions based on them. Also === is stricter that ==, because "5"==5 returns true.

## Video 26
Examples of if. It helped me see how conditions control flow, by using a lot of successive if statements.A common error metionned is using a single = inside an if statement, which accidentally changes the variable value instead of checking it.

## Video 27
I learned that switch is a cleaner alternative to long if/else chains when you have many specific cases to check. It makes the code more organized.

## Video 28
Demo on the switch, it was made clear that break is important, because without it, all the coming cases will also run.

## Video 29
This video shows how to create an array [].It is data type like a list, but it is indexed starting from 0

## Video 30
This was about the use of arrays, the examples shows how to store different types of variables inside the same array, and that was interesting.

## Video 31
This video taught me that arrays are dynamic, which mean you can add remove or change elements inside them. The .push() is used to items to the end of the array.

## Video 32
This was a demo on how to create and work with array: add remove change.
Also if you wanna retrieve something from an inexistant array, the console returns undefined.

## Video 33
This video introduced interesting and really good tools like find, filter, and map. These methods allow you to search through or transform whole lists of data with a small code. Like .forEach(), it replaces repeating manual loops.

## Video 34
Demo on array methods where the examples used .filter() and .find().The ,find() only gives first match, while .filter() gives all the matches there.

## Video 35
Loops allow you to repeat an action multiple times without rewriting code. I learned the difference between for loops and while loops, and that is like any other algorithm.

## Video 36
Demo on the loops. The example was about how to iterate between the elements of an array.A common beginner error is using i <= array.length instead of i < array.length.

## Video 37
This was about functions that you can use throughout your code, and avoid repetition, and keeps the code DRY as saif by the programmers.

## Video 38
Demo showing how functions works in examples. There was an example where you should pass a parameter, if you dont, the variable become undefined inside the function

## Video 39
This was about arrow and anonymous functions, a more modern, short way to write functions. For example (x) => x * 2

## Video 40
Demo on arrow functions, there was a comparison between them and traditional ones. I learned that arrow functions dont have their own this keyword, which is a detail that matters more in advanced coding and not for beginners.

## Video 41
I learned that JSON is the universal language of data on the internet. It’s the way different systems talk to each other.I also learned JSON keys must be in double quotes for example "name": "Mehdi".

## Video 42
Another demo showing how to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string and back again. This is important for saving data or sending it over a network. We used JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(). If you try to parse a string that isn't perfect JSON, you'll get a SyntaxError: Unexpected token.

## Video 43
This was about how objects allow you to group related data and functions together.Using curly braces {}. Objects are for "things" (like a car with color and brand) while arrays are for "lists."

## Video 44
Demo on objects. The example shows how to add new properties. You can use dot notation for example car.color = 'blue' to change values.

## Video 45
I learned that Promises are used for "asynchronous" tasks that take time, like downloading a file.I learned how JS handles waiting without freezing also that a Promise can be "Pending," "Fulfilled," or "Rejected".

## Video 46
Demo on Promises that shows .then() and .catch(). Without the .catch(), a failed download will cause an error.

## Video 47
What async/await does, is to make asynchronous code a lttle bit more sychronous. To be honnest, it was hard to follow up and understand.
## Video 48
Demonstrates async/await examples. In the previous theory video, async was hard to understand, but with this i understood more. And wthe example demonstrated the await keyword and if you forget await, the code continues instantly and you'll get a 'Promise' object instead of the actual data.
## Video 49
what is a package in javascript, a reusable bundle of code like libraries, tools like react given as example. They're important to save time. Most popular software registry is NPM. Two types of packages were also mentionned, depencies and devdependencies.
## Video 50
This video was mainly a practice from what was said in the previous one. It shows how to use npm packages, for example how to add libraries.

## Video 51
There was a thanking speech and also he advised to practice more on the github to the channel that contains example to train on.
